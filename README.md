# OnlineBookStore
This project aims to develop a web application which is an online book store using model-view-controller (MVC) concept. It utilizes HttpServlet as controllers and Java Server Pages as views. Its current functionality includes: register new users, login and logout, browse books according to categories, search for specific books, add books to cart, purchase books, update sales and stocks, recommend books to users, write reviews, etc.

## How to use the code:
1. download the project
2. download and set up tomcat
3. set up your own database (server, connector, etc) and write the connection pool details in web/META-INF/context.xml
4. run sql/data.sql to create schemas.
5. run the code and open any browser to http://localhost:8080/ (default if you didn't change).

## Future work
1. add more books and users to the database.
2. migrates the platform using more powerful frameworks, including springMVC and Hibernate.
